## Testing Requirements

Every feature MUST include tests. Use this checklist:

### Unit Tests (Game Logic)

For every new game mechanic:

- [ ] **Happy path** - Feature works as designed
  ```javascript
  test('should [expected behavior]', () => {
    // Arrange
    const game = new RadioactiveFroggies(12345);

    // Act
    const result = game.newFeature();

    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe(expectedValue);
  });
  ```

- [ ] **Edge cases** - Boundaries and limits
  ```javascript
  test('should handle [edge case]', () => {
    // Test minimum values
    // Test maximum values
    // Test empty states
    // Test full states
  });
  ```

- [ ] **Error cases** - Invalid input
  ```javascript
  test('should fail gracefully with [invalid input]', () => {
    const result = game.invalidOperation();
    expect(result.valid).toBe(false);
  });
  ```

- [ ] **State management** - Init/reset/update
  ```javascript
  test('should reset [feature] on game reset', () => {
    game.useFeature();
    game.reset();
    expect(game.featureState).toBe(initialState);
  });
  ```

### Integration Tests (UI)

For every new UI component:

- [ ] **Rendering** - Elements exist
  ```javascript
  test('should display [UI element]', () => {
    const element = document.getElementById('new-element');
    expect(element).toBeDefined();
  });
  ```

- [ ] **Interactions** - Clicks/inputs work
  ```javascript
  test('should [action] when [UI element] clicked', () => {
    element.click();
    expect(game.state).toBe(expectedState);
  });
  ```

- [ ] **State updates** - UI reflects changes
  ```javascript
  test('should update [UI element] when [state] changes', () => {
    game.changeState();
    expect(element.textContent).toBe(newValue);
  });
  ```

- [ ] **Visual feedback** - Animations/classes
  ```javascript
  test('should add [CSS class] on [action]', () => {
    performAction();
    expect(element.classList.contains('active')).toBe(true);
  });
  ```

## Example: Complete Feature Development

### Feature: Shield Powerup

**Description:** Add a shield powerup that protects against one incorrect probe

**Todo List:**
```
- [ ] Design shield mechanics
  - Shield activates on use
  - Prevents 1 move deduction on miss
  - Visual indicator when active
  - Auto-expires after use or 5 turns

- [ ] Implement game logic
  - Add 'shield' to powerup types
  - Add shieldActive flag to game state
  - Add shieldTurnsRemaining counter
  - Modify probe() to check shield status
  - Update getState() to include shield info

- [ ] Add UI components
  - Shield icon in powerup inventory
  - Shield active indicator near grid
  - Shield count badge
  - Click handler for activation

- [ ] Write unit tests (8 tests)
  - [ ] Should activate shield successfully
  - [ ] Should prevent move deduction on miss
  - [ ] Should expire after one use
  - [ ] Should expire after 5 turns
  - [ ] Should not activate when none available
  - [ ] Should reset on game reset
  - [ ] Should include in game state
  - [ ] Should not affect caught frogs

- [ ] Write integration tests (4 tests)
  - [ ] Should display shield UI
  - [ ] Should show active indicator when used
  - [ ] Should update count when used
  - [ ] Should disable button when unavailable

- [ ] Update documentation
  - [ ] Add shield to README features
  - [ ] Add shield test examples to TESTING.md
  - [ ] Add JSDoc comments to new methods

- [ ] Verify and commit

  - [ ] Works on mobile and desktop
  - [ ] Commit with descriptive message
  - [ ] Push to feature branch
```

**Testing Plan:**
- 8 unit tests for game logic
- 4 integration tests for UI
- Total test count: 124 â†’ 136

**Success Criteria:**
- Shield activates and deactivates correctly
- Move count protected when shield active
- UI clearly shows shield status
- All tests passing
- Documentation complete

## Tips for Success

### Start with Tests
Consider writing tests first (TDD):
1. Write failing test defining behavior
2. Implement feature to pass test
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

### Break Down Large Features
If a feature has >10 tasks, break it into smaller features:
- Phase 1: Core functionality + tests
- Phase 2: UI enhancements + tests
- Phase 3: Advanced features + tests

### Ask for Review
Before marking complete:
- Self-review the code
- Run tests multiple times
- Test edge cases manually
- Consider asking teammate to review

### Keep It Simple
- Start with minimal viable feature
- Add complexity only if needed
- Optimize after it works
- Test before and after optimization

## Questions?

- Check [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for testing patterns
- Review existing features for examples
- Ask in PR review comments
- Update this template when you find gaps

Happy developing! ðŸš€
